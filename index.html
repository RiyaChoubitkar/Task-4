        The state of Goa, in India, is famous for its beaches and places of worship. Tourism is its primary industry,
        and is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with decreased tourist activity inland.

        Foreign tourists, mostly from Europe, arrive in Goa in winter, whilst the summer and monsoon seasons see many
        Indian tourists. Goa handled 2.29% of all foreign tourist arrivals in the country in 2011.[1][2] This relatively
        small state is situated on the west coast of India, between the borders of Maharashtra and Karnataka, and is
        better known to the world as a former Portuguese enclave on Indian soil. Thus, Tourism forms the backbone of
        Goa's economy.[3]

        Major tourist attractions include Bom Jesus Basilica, Fort Aguada, a wax museum on Indian culture, and a
        heritage museum. The Churches and Convents of Goa have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
